          <div class="mt-6 mb-10 p-6 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg shadow-md border border-gray-200 text-gray-800">
            <p class="mb-2 mt-0">Dear Senator [Name],</p>
            <p class="mb-2">I write as a concerned Utah voter urging you to oppose all <strong>U.S. military funding to Israel</strong>, given the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
              <li>Under the current 2016 Memorandum of Understanding, the U.S. provides approximately <strong>$3.8 billion per year</strong> in military aid to Israel, with <strong>nearly all of it spent on weapons and defense systems.</strong></li>
              <li>Since October 7, 2023, U.S. taxpayers have already supplied at least <strong>$17.9 billion in military assistance</strong>, the highest amount ever delivered in a single year, including arms transfers and drawdowns from stockpiles.</li>
              <li>That adds up to <strong>over $22 billion of military spending</strong> related to the Gaza war and regional operations in one year alone.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-2">In practical terms, <strong>the average U.S. taxpayer contributes at least $25 per year in weapons support for Israel.</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-2">Given these facts, I respectfully request that you:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Call to <strong>halt U.S. military aid</strong> immediately.</li>
              <li>Withhold weapons transfers until a full human rights review is conducted.</li>
              <li>Press Congress to defund Israel until there is a verifiable ceasefire and civilian protection plan in place.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mb-8">This is not just a fiscal issue—it’s a moral crisis. U.S. aid is directly fueling bombing campaigns that imperil civilians in Gaza. Please stand with Utah voters and demand accountability now. I respectfully ask that you respond and let me know where you stand on this issue.</p>

            <p class="mb-2 mt-0">Dear Senator [Name],</p>
            <p class="mb-2">I am a Utah citizen writing to you not just with concern, but with heartbreak. What we are witnessing in Gaza is unbearable: families buried under rubble, mothers carrying their dying children through streets filled with smoke, entire generations erased in minutes.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">And yet, our government continues to fund it.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">It is devastating to know that U.S. tax dollars — my tax dollars — are contributing to this suffering. Each bomb dropped, each child lost, each hospital destroyed — it’s paid for, in part, by us.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">This is not about politics. It’s about humanity.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">I urge you to do everything in your power to:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
              <li>End military aid to Israel immediately.</li>
              <li>Stop sending bombs and weapons that fuel this devastation.</li>
              <li>Demand a permanent ceasefire and protection of civilians.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-2">There is no justification for continuing to fund such pain.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">Please, let our state — and our nation — be on the right side of history.</p>
            <p class="mb-8">Use your position to stop this. Choose life over war. Choose compassion over complicity. Please reply to let me know your position and how you plan to act on this matter.</p>

              <li>The U.S. gives <strong>$3.8 billion in military aid to Israel every year</strong> — that’s about <strong>$25 per taxpayer</strong>, and it’s directly funding the destruction in Gaza.</li>
              <li>Since October 2023, over <strong>30,000 Palestinians have been killed</strong>, many of them women and children.</li>
              <li>Our government should not be funding bombs while people in Gaza are starving, dehydrated, and denied medical care.</li>
              <li>I’m asking the Senator to push for a <strong>ceasefire</strong>, the <strong>safe entry of humanitarian aid</strong>, and an <strong>end to all military funding to Israel</strong> until civilian lives are protected.</li>

            <p class="mb-2">
              I cannot believe our country is still <strong>sending bombs and money</strong> while thousands of innocent people are being slaughtered. Mothers are digging their children out of rubble. Hospitals are bombed. People are starving — and we’re funding it.

            <p class="mb-2">
              This is <strong>not self-defense. It’s a massacre.</strong> And it’s happening with our support.
