          <h3>The rise of Zionism and tensions</h3>
          <p>In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Zionism — a movement calling for a Jewish homeland — gained momentum. After centuries of persecution, especially the Holocaust, many Jewish people believed they needed their own safe nation.</p>
          <p>More Jews began migrating to Palestine. Tensions rose between Jewish immigrants and the local Palestinian Arabs, who feared losing their land and identity.</p>
          <h3>1947–1948: A major turning point</h3>
          <p>The United Nations proposed a plan to split the land into two states — one Jewish, one Arab. The Jewish leaders accepted it. The Arab leaders didn’t, believing it was unfair (they were the majority at the time and were being given less land).</p>
          <p>In 1948, Israel declared independence. War broke out with neighboring Arab countries. Over 700,000 Palestinians were displaced — this is known as the Nakba ("catastrophe" in Arabic). Some fled, others were forced out. Their homes were taken, and most were never allowed to return.</p>
          <h3>What followed</h3>
          <p>Israel grew stronger, with support from powerful allies. Many Palestines ended up in refugee camps, stateless, living under military occupation or in exile.</p>
          <p>In 1967, after another war, Israel occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza — lands that were supposed to be part of a future Palestinian state. That occupation has never ended. Israeli settlements (illegal under international law) have expanded in the West Bank ever since.</p>
          <h3>And Gaza?</h3>
          <p>Gaza is a small, densely populated strip of land. In 2006, Hamas, a Palestinian political and militant group, won elections there. Israel and Egypt quickly imposed a blockade — cutting off movement, goods, jobs.</p> 
          <p>It's been described by human rights groups as an open-air prison.</p>
          <h3>So what’s happening now?</h3>
          <p>This latest war did not start October 2023. Decades of displacement, military occupation, siege, airstrikes, rocket fire, and loss built up to this. The October 7 Hamas attack on Israeli civilians was horrifying. Over 1,100 people were killed, including children.</p>
          <p>But since then, Israel has launched a full-scale assault on Gaza, killing now 60,000 people — most of them women and children. Entire neighborhoods have been flattened. Food, water, and medical care have been cut off. The UN and international law experts have warned that this is genocide.</p>
          <p>It is also important to note that after the first strike on Israelis, Hamas is still holding 50 men and women, including two Americans, captive in Gaza.</p>
          <h3>Who’s right? Who’s wrong? (My opinion)</h3>
          <p>This is not about choosing a side. It’s about choosing humanity. Both Israeli and Palestinian civilians deserve safety, freedom, and dignity. You can care about Jewish safety and still be heartbroken and angry about the treatment of Palestinians.</p>
          <p>It’s about land, control, fear, loss and generations of people being dehumanized. Governments and armed groups should be held accountable. But people, especially children, should not pay the price for politics and power.</p>
